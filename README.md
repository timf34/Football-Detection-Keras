# Football-Detection-Keras
Football Detection CNN built in Keras

Created a computer vision model to track footballs during football games in real time. This is still a work in progress. Current network was built in Keras and inspired by DeepBall (Komorowski 2019). 

Still TODO:
Add data augmentation to the data generator

Add a function to empirically test how accurate the current model is. 

Create a Validation Callback 

Try out different loss functions. 

Tidy everything up considerably.
