# Football-Detection-Keras
Football Detection CNN built in Keras

Created a computer vision model to track footballs during football games in real time. This is still a work in progress. Current network was built in Keras and inspired by DeepBall (Komorowski 2019). 

Still TODO:
Add data augmentation to the data generator

Add a function to empirically test how accurate the current model is. 

Create a Validation Callback 

Try out different loss functions. 

Add trainable up convolutions to model

Use epipolar geometry to fuse information from two cameras to accurately locate the ball

Tidy everything up considerably.
