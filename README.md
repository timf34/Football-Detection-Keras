# Football Net Keras
Football Detection CNN built in Keras

Created a computer vision model to track footballs during football games in real time. Current network was built in Keras and inspired by DeepBall (Komorowski 2019). 

Still TODO:

Create a Validation Callback 

Try out different loss functions. 

Use epipolar geometry to fuse information from two cameras to accurately locate the ball

Tidy everything up considerably.
